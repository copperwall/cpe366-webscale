   * UI Basics

   Here are some helpful basics for navigating the UI.

      * From anywhere on the site, clicking the "Holidank Inn" text in the upper left
        of each page will return you to the home page.

      * Every table has an edit button on the right that will bring you to the edit
        page for that row. 

   Thank you for reading our Helpful Tips and Tricks!

2. Admin Actions

   Only administrators can perform admin actions. Administrators can see the
   features of the application available to employees and users as well.

   * Adding Employees

   To add an employee, start by loggin into the application with an admin
   account. In the navigation bar, click "User List" to be presented
   with a listing of all registered employees, users and admins. Scroll to the
   bottom of this page to find the Create Employee form.

   Specify the login, password, first name, last name, email, and role
   for the Employee to be created and click "Create". Upon successful 
   creation you will be redirected to the edit page for the new employee. 
   At this point, you may return to the home page by clicking the "Holidank Inn" 
   text, or return to the employee list page by clicking "User List".

   * Editing Employees

   To edit an employee's attributes, start by logging into the application
   with an admin account. In the navigation bar, click "User List"
   to be presented with a list of all registered employees and users.

   Find the employee, user, or admin you would like to edit in the list. 
   Under the "Actions" column in the list, click the "Edit" link in the 
   same column to bring up the edit page.

   Change any information you would like and press the "Update" button when finished. 
   Upon successful edit, the edit page will be reloaded and you will see
   that your edit has been saved. You are free to leave the page.

   * Deleting Employees

   To delete an employee, log in as an admin user. Click "User List"
   in the navigation bar. Select the user you wish to delete as you did
   in editing employees.

   You will be brought to the Employee edit page, where you can click
   "Delete" in the bottom left. Upon successful deletion you will be
   returned to the employee list page.

   * Editing Room Rates
   To edit a rate for a room, start by loggin into the application with an 
   admin account. In the navigation bar, click "Edit Room Rates". This will
   show you all current rate overrides and allow you to insert a new one.

   To insert a new rate, select the room, duration, and input the rate then
   press the "Submit" button to the right.

   The page will refresh and you should see your edited rate in the table
   at the bottom of the page.

3. Employee Use

   What fun would the application be if it were just for administrators? We
   care deeply about our employee users and want to make their experience
   effortless and lovely.

   An employee has access to all the features that a customer has (see Part 4 - 
   Customer Use below). In addition, we have provided employees with a special
   "Front Desk" feature that allows them to keep track of guests.

   To access the Front Desk feature, log in to the application with an employee
   account. In the navigation bar, click on "Front Desk". This will open the Front
   Desk page. From here you can see a table with all guests that are checking in today
   and a table with all guests that are checking out today. In addition, the specific
   check-in and check-out times are provided. 

   * Editing a Booking
   
   In these tables, you can click on the corresponding "Edit" button in the right 
   of each row to bring up the edit page for the booking. Once on the edit page, you

   status, room number, start and end dates, rates, payments, and total charges.
